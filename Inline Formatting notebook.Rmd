R Markdown is a file format for making dynamic documents with R. It provides an authoring frame work of data science. The R Markdown has two main purpose: 
1. Save and execute code
2. Generate high quality reports that can be shared with audience

R Markdown documents can support various of dynamic and static output format, such as pdf or Html. The syntax of R Markdown is also important, students need to learn how to write Markdown syntax to produce a concise and clear reports. 



## 1. Workflow

1.1 Open a new.Rmd file in the RStudio IED by goting to File > New File > R Markdown

1.2 Embed code in chunks, run code by line, by chunk, or all at once.

1.3 Write text and add tables, images, figures, and citations. Format with Markdown syntax of the RStudio Visual Markdown Editor.

1.4 Set Output format(s) and options in the YAML header. Customize themes or add parameters to execute or add interactivity with Shiny.

1.5 Save and render the whole document. Knit periodically to preview your work as you write.

1.6 Present or share your work. 


## 2. Inline Formatting

2.1 _Italic_ inline text: surrounded by underscores or asterisks (e.g., `_text_` or `*text*`)

2.2 **Bold** text: produced using a pair of double asterisks or surrounded by two underscores (e.g., `**text**` or `__text_``). 

2.3 Turn text to a subscript: using a pair of tildes (`~`) (e.g., `H~3~PO~4~` renders H~3~PO~4~)

2.4 Turn text to a superscript: using a pair of carets(`^`) (e.g., `Cu^2+^` renders Cu^2^+)

2.5 add line in the text: using two pair of tildes(`~~`), (e.g., `~~text~~` renders ~~text~~)

2.6 hyperlink: use the syntax `[text](link), (e.g., `[link](www.rstudio.com)` renders [link](www.rstudio.com))

2.7 Mark text as `inline code`: use a pair of backticks, (e.g., `` `code` ``), to include n literal backticks, use at least n+1 backticks outside, (e.g., you can use three backticks to preserve two backtick inside: ```` ``` ``code`` ``` ````, which is rendered as ``` ``code`` ``` )

2.8

` ``` `

`text`

` ``` ` 
will renders 

```
text 
```


2.9 `>block quotes` will render as

>block quotes

2.10 Equation: `$e^{i \pi} +1 = 0$` renders $e^{i \pi} +1 = 0$

2.11 Equation blocks: `$$E = mc^{2}$$` renders 
$$E = mc^{2}$$
2.12 '- ordered list' renders 

- ordered list

2.13 text size: use number sign `#` to adjust the text size for header, as the `#` increase, the size of header decrease.

(e.g., `# Header` renders

# Header


(e.g., `#### Header` renders

#### Header

2.14 Syntax for images: add an exclamation mark, (e.g., `![alt text or image title](path/to/image)`)

2.15 Footnotes: put inside the square brackets after a caret `^`, (e.g., `^[This is a footnote].`)

2.16 Insert citation: typing [@cite] or @cite

2.17 Plain text: just type text in the chunk.

2.18 Start a new paragraph: End a line with two spaces to start a new paragraph

2.19 make a new line: End with a backslash to make a new line

2.20 special symbol, (e.g., escaped: `\*\_ \\` renders escaped: \*\_ \\)

2.21 endash: (e.g., `endash:--,` renders endash:--; `endash:---,` renders endash:---,)

2.22 List: `- unordered list' renders

- unordered list

2.23 Ordered List: 

| - Item 1
|    - Item 1a
|    - Item 2b
|                renders

- Item 1
  - Item 1a
  - Item 2b
  
2.24 Indent text: use line blocks by starting the line with a vertical bar (|). The line breaks and any leading spaces will be preserved in the output. e.g., 

```\
| R is free software and comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.
|     R is a collaborative project with many contributors.
| You are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions.
|      Platform: x86_64-apple-darwin17.0 (64-bit)
```

The out put is 

>
| R is free software and comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.
|     R is a collaborative project with many contributors.
| You are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions.
|      Platform: x86_64-apple-darwin17.0 (64-bit)

2.25 Generate a grey text block: start with ` ```\ ` and end with ` ``` `, write text with in the block, e.g.,

` ```\`

R is a useful software.

` ``` `

The output is 

```\
R is a useful software.
```


## 3. Out put format

3.1 html_document creates .html

3.2 pdf_document* creates .pdf

3.3 word_document creates .docx(Microsoft Word)

3.4 powerpoint_presentation creates .pptx(Microsoft Powerpoint)

3.5 odt_document creates OpenDocument Text

3.6 md_document creates Markdown

3.7 github_document creates Markdown for Github

3.8 ioslides_presentation creates ioslides HTML slides

3.9 slidy_presentation creates Slidy HTML slides

3.10 rtf_document creates Rich Text Format

3.11 beamer_presentation creates Beamer Slides

3.12 Requires LateX, bookdown or other format, use tinytex::install_tinytex()

For the output format names in the YAML metadata of an Rmd file, you need to include the package name if a format is from an extension package, e.g., 

```\
output:tufte::tufte_html
```

If the format is from the Rmarkdown package, you do not need the rmarkdown:: prefix

## 4. Embed Code with knitr

4.1 CODE CHUNKS

Surround code chunks with ```` ```{r}``` ```` or use the insert Code Chunk button. Add a chunk label and/or chunk options inside  the curly braces after r. 

```\
`  ```{r chunk-label, include = False}
summary(mtcars)``` ` 
```

4.2 SET GLOBAL OPTIONS 

Set options for the entire document in the first chunk.

```\
`  ```{r include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE)``` ` 

```

4.3 INLINE CODE

Set `r<code>` into text sections. Code is evaluated at render and results appear as text. 

## 5. Render

Important args:

5.1 input- file to render

5.2 output_options - list of render options(as in YAML)

5.3 output_file/output_dir
