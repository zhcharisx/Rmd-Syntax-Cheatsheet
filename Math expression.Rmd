In side a text chunk of rmd file, you can use mathematical notation with dollar sign in two different styles.

Inline LaTeX equations can be written if you surround it by a pair of dollar signs using the LaTeX syntax, for example  `$f(k) = {n \choose k} p^{k} (1-p)^{n-k}$ ` will produce $f(k) = {n \choose k} p^{k} (1-p)^{n-k}$

Display style math expressions can be written in a pair of double dollar signs, for example  `$$f(k) = {n \choose k} p^{k} (1-p)^{n-k}$$ ` will produce $$f(k) = {n \choose k} p^{k} (1-p)^{n-k}$$
